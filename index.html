      <h3>What is beatbox?</h3>
       <p>
        Beatbox essentially is the ability to replicate and create percussion sounds using only your mouth. 
        Initially the artform focused primarily on the sole replication of percussion-based instruments, however 
        it has developed and grown into so much more than just that. Beatboxing is filled with a diverse range of sounds spanning anywhere from scratches 
        and snares to trumpets, sirens and zippers.

          <h3>Where it all Began?</h3>
          <p>It is usually documented that beatboxing, as we know it, has its roots in the beginning of modern hip-hop, on street corners in placed like Chicago, 
              the Bronx, and LA, and this is quite right. However, vocal percussion - the art form from which beatboxing spawns - has been part of the music and 
              urban scene for a lot longer than people think. As part of the new school of beatboxing and hip-hop - that is, from around 1998 to today - it is extremely 
              important this new school knows its history, and the way in which this glorious sub culture came about. Through hard research, I will attempt to show you, 
              the reader, the true (but brief) history of beatboxing.
              <p>It first requires a trip back in time, more than 7 decades back, to the era of swing, jazz and barbershop music. It has been well recorded that jazz
                 musicians where the first group of artists who used their voices, and indeed, their whole vocal chords to imitate instruments. When bebop arrived in the 30’s, 
                 as a reaction to large swing groups and their lack of improvisation, it was becoming the norm to hear jazz and blues singers wail, moan or grunt noises unidentifiable 
                 to the human ear as words. 'Scatting' was used as jazz singers improvised harmonic and vocal scales over solos or instrumentals. This was the first mainstream 
                 look at what would become vocal percussion, and later beatboxing. Singers would sing made up words such as 'doot', 'wawp', 'bapadoo' and many others, 
                 effectively imitating the sounds of the two most common instruments in their music, saxophones and trumpets. However, the roots of imitating instruments 
                 with the human voice goes a few years earlier.
